#
#   APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY  Developer ID Application: …   (default: `-`, ad-hoc)
#   APPLE_ID                the Apple ID for notarytool
#   APPLE_PASSWORD          its app-specific password
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID           the team the certificate belongs to
#
# This stops at notarization and does not staple: a ticket cannot be attached to
# a bare Mach-O. `stapler` writes into a bundle's Contents/CodeResources or a
# disk image's metadata, and a single executable has nowhere to put one. A
# notarized CLI binary therefore still costs the first machine that runs it one
# online check with Apple, which is fine for a build artifact.
#
# A no-op off macOS, so the Linux packaging path can call it unconditionally.
